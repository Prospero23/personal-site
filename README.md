This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

This is my personal website. React Three Fiber and the like. The 3D model of me on the homepage was made using photogrammetry and Blender. 


## UPDATES NEEDED: 

- 3d model improvements (load and move with keys)
- add new projects / records
- clean all the code...
- fix about me
- fix changing between sax and laptop not having correct offset
- fix weird glitching out on code page... maybe change how code page is displayed.
- add reset button for position on music page
## Thoughts on code page redesign:
- move into different categories? web development, maxmsp, native, opensource etc
