## Description
[ORhythmic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orhythmic/id6742388100) is an iOS app designed for musicians working with complex, nested rhythms that are hard (or impossible) to practice with traditional metronomes.

Instead of inputting rhythms as Western notation or in a grid, users build [rhythm trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/introduction-to-tree-data-structure/) made of nodes that can be combined or subdivided into any number of children (2, 5, 37, etc.), and ORhythmic handles the math, playback, and visualization. 

The design of the rhythm model was influenced heavily by the music of [Brian Ferneyhough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Ferneyhough) and the rhythmic structure of [OpenMusic](https://openmusic-project.github.io/).

## Technical Notes
- **Platform:** Native iOS app built with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/). Notation handled in a [`WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)
- **Audio Engine:** Custom scheduling layer on top of [AudioKit / AVAudioEngine](https://www.audiokit.io/) for sample accurate playback using 121 different sounds
- **Notation:** Uses [VexFlow](https://github.com/vexflow/vexflow/) for score rendering. Basic flow can be seen in the companion TypeScript library [`@orhythmic/rhythm-tree-converter`](https://github.com/Prospero23/rhythm-tree-converter)
- **Persistence:** Uses [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata) to allow users to save sequences locally on their devices
