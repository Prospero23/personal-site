## Description
This is one of my live performance setups. It uses two iPads as MIDI controllers to manipulate a pair of custom synthesizers 
and a suite of audio effects. The interface is designed for fast timbral shifts, allowing me to respond fluidly to acoustic improvisers in real time.

This system, and modules derived from it, has been used on many 
of my [laptop recordings and performances](./music). 

## Technical Notes
- **Synthesis** [Max For Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) instruments running inside [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/)
- **Control Mapping** Uses [FluCoMa](https://www.flucoma.org/) for feature extraction and parameter regression, reducing high-dimensional synth controls (10D and 50D) 
into touch-controllable 2D/4D spaces
- **MIDI** Dual iPads running [touchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc)
