## Description
VISS 0 is an audio-reactive scoring system that maps three distinct video effects to three equally distinct improvisational systems. 
It was influenced greatly by a lecture led by [Craig Vear](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/humanities/departments/music/people/craig.vear) on digital scoring practices. Inspired by this lecture,
each improvisational system varies both in its degree of interactivity with the performer and its level of notational specificity, ranging from abstract numerical ranges to traditional notation.

The system was first developed and recorded during [Don-Paul Kahl](https://donpaulkahl.com/en/about)'s residency at NEC in 2023. 
Later that year, it was performed live at the [TENOR](https://www.tenor-conference.org/) conference in Boston.

Specific performance notes can be read in the [README](https://github.com/Prospero23/VISS-0/blob/main/other/README.md) of the project.

## Technical Details
- **Notation** Uses [bach](https://www.bachproject.net/) for reactive graphic score overlays and the basis of the live transcription engine
- **Audio Analysis** Uses [FluCoMa](https://www.flucoma.org/) for loudness and onset detection
- **Video Effects** Uses Jitter and Vizzie for score rendering and video effects

## Added Thoughts/Context
My improvised musical practice has often centered around finding ways to rapidly shift between multiple, contrasting improvisational logics.
This project was an attempt to notate this process.

While writing this piece, I was also influenced by Ferneyhough's idea that extreme or overwhelming constraints bring out the best of human creativity.
Throughout a performance, the performer is overloaded with information, forcing them to make concessions and decisions they might never otherwise make.
