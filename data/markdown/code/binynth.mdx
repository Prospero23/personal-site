## Description
[binSynth](https://binsynth.vercel.app/) is a web instrument and daily challenge platform. 
Each user can sign in and record a short (10 second) improvisation once per day using a 
synthesizer built into the site. Users can then watch each other's performances, leave feedback, and explore 
a growing community-driven archive of sketches.

## Technical Notes
- **Frontend**: Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) 

- **Synthesis / Audio Engine**: Implemented using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

- **Authentication**: Managed through a secure login flow with user-specific daily submission tracking using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)

- **Database**: Stores user profiles, daily recordings, and comments for community playback in [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Context
This was my first large-scale web project, designed to help me learn authentication and full-stack user flow design. 
The audio features are intentionally simple, with the interactive and social components serving as the core focus of the work.
