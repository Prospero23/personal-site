# Bio
I play music, organize [concerts](https://bigsound.live/) and code.

I graduated from The New England Conservatory with a degree in
Jazz Performance and have performed throughout the United States
in various groups on both saxophone and laptop at
festivals/conferences including the Catalytic Sound Festival and
TENOR.

I have made software for musical performances, native devices,
and the web. More information can be found on the
respective pages about these things.

Please reach out!
